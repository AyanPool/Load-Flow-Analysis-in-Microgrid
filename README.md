This project provides an in-depth analysis of load flow in DC and AC Microgrids using MATLAB simulations. 
It examines the steady-state behavior of power systems, focusing on voltage, current, and power distribution.
The project employs the Newton-Raphson method for DC microgrids and the modified Gauss-Seidel method for AC microgrids in islanded mode. 
The analysis aims to evaluate the performance of these methods in determining voltage magnitudes, phase angles, and power flows within the microgrid systems.
